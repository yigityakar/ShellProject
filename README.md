Important notes about our project:

1. The shellax-skeleton.c file is the earliest version of the file. We did not update it with the new rllwrap lines, so watch out for possible errors with arrow keys.
2. Before starting the shell, please compile each file with the given executable name below:
  * uniq:  ````$ gcc -o newuniq newuniq.c````
  * psvis:  ````$ gcc -o psvis psvis.c````
  * chatroom: ````$ gcc -o chatroom chatroom.c````
  * custom command #1: ````$ gcc -o minezone minezone.c````
  * custom command #2: ````$ gcc -o blackjack blackjack.c````
  
3. To compile the kernel module, enter ````$ make```` command to the command prompt. 
4. You have to be a superuser to run psvis command. So the skeleton code must be run with ````$ sudo ./<skeleton executable name>```` command.
